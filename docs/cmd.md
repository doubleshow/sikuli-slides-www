To execute slides (e.g., [helloworld.pptx](/pptx/helloworld.pptx)), type the following in the command line:

{% highlight bash %}
$ {{site.slides.executable}} execute helloworld.pptx 
{% endhighlight %}

## Executing Remote Files

If the file is hosted on a remote web server, you can execute it by supplying the URL to that remote file as an argument. Sikuli Slides will try to download the file for you and executing it. For instance, suppose helloworld.pptx is hosted at the URL  [http://silides.sikuli.org/helloworld.pptx](http://silides.sikuli.org/helloworld.pptx), you can execute this remote file as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
$ {{site.slides.executable}} execute http://slides.sikuli.org/helloworld.pptx 
{% endhighlight %}

If the file is a Google Presentation hosted on Google Drive, you can execute it by supplying its public sharing link. Make sure you have already set the file's sharing setting as "Anyone who has the link can **view**". This enables Sikuli Slides to download the file for you.

{% highlight bash %}
$ {{site.slides.executable}} execute \\
   https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w48gExh5oLIT0J8xYXR1RxpqTrZTXJC8OR4UXxShTQ8/edit?usp=sharing
{% endhighlight %}
