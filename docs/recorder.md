Sikuli Slides Recorder is a utility to help you quickly generate drafts of slides by recording your interactions with an interface.

To start the recorder, run the following command in a terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
$ {{site.slides.executable}} record
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you will see these message.

On Mac/Linux
{% highlight bash %}
Press [Ctrl-Shift-2] to start recording
Press [Ctrl-Shift-ESC] to stop recording
{% endhighlight %}

On Windows
{% highlight bash %}
Press [Alt-Shift-2] to start recording
Press [Alt-Shift-ESC] to stop recording
{% endhighlight %}

It is time to switch to the interface you want to generate slides for. When you are ready, press `Ctrl-Shift-2` (or `Alt-Shift-2` on Windows) to start recording. Each time you click or type, the recorder will record it as an event. When you are done, press `Ctrl-Shift-ESC` (or `Alt-Shift-ESC` on Windows) to stop recording. The events that were recorded will be converted into a series of slides and written to a `.pptx` file. On each slide is a screenshot accomplished by a text box with an action word and a rectangle around the target. Below are examples of the draft slides generated by the recorder.

{% include action_examples_3.html name="recorder_draft" %}

These slides are just drafts. Note that all the target rectangles are of the same size. This is because by default the recorder does not try to guess the size of the target you click. So it just places a small rectangle centered on where you click, assuming that you want full control in adjusting the rectangle's location and size. After some quick revisions, the final slides may look like below.

{% include action_examples_3.html name="recorder_revised" %}

Now your slides are ready to be executed!

## Controlling the Recorder

There are some aspects of the recorder's behaviors you can control.

By default, slides are written to a file in the same directory where you start the recorder. The file is named using the current time, such as `2013-08-12-06-33-53.pptx`. You can specify a different file location using the `output` flag.

{% highlight bash %}
$ {{site.slides.executable}} record -output myfile.pptx
{% endhighlight %}

By default, the whole screen is captured. You can specify a smaller region to record using the `region` flag.
{% highlight bash %}
$ {{site.slides.executable}} record -region 100,100,640,480
{% endhighlight %}
