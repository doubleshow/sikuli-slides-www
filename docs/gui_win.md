On some Windows systems, the installer may fail to properly associate `.pptx` files with Sikuli Slides. When this happens, you won't find Sikuli Slides as an option under the *Open With* menu. These are the steps you can follow to make this association on your own. 

Select "Open With"
   
{% include figure.html src="/img/gui_win1.png" %}   
   
Select "Browse..."

{% include figure.html src="/img/gui_win2.png" %}   

Select the "Sikuli Slides" directory

{% include figure.html src="/img/gui_win3.png" %}      

Select the "sikuli-slides" program and then select "Open"
  
{% include figure.html src="/img/gui_win4.png" %}      

You are done! Your slides should be executed now. Next time when you try to open an `.pptx` file, Sikuli Slides will become available as an option.
