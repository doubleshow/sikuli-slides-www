On some Windows systems, the installer may fail to properly associate `.pptx` files with Sikuli Slides. When this happens, you won't find Sikuli Slides as an option under the *Open With* menu. These are the steps you can follow to make this association on your own. 

1. Select "Open With"
   
   <img src="/img/gui_win1.png"  class="two-thirds img-polaroid"/>  

   
2. Select "Browse..."
   
   <img src="/img/gui_win2.png"  class="two-thirds img-polaroid"/>


3. Select the "Sikuli Slides" directory
   
   <img src="/img/gui_win3.png"  class="two-thirds img-polaroid"/>


4. Select the "sikuli-slides" program and then select "Open"
   
   <img src="/img/gui_win4.png"  class="two-thirds img-polaroid"/>




You are done! Your slides should be executed now. Next time when you try to open an `.pptx` file, Sikuli Slides will become available as an option.
