Sikuli Slides can understand slides made by Microsoft Powerpoint or Google Presentation. You can use either editing tool to make your slides.  Chances are you are already familiar with these tools. This is one of the  advantages of Sikuli Slides. There is no need to learn a new programming editor or IDE! Just make slides as you did before. Just make sure you save your slides in the `.pptx` format.

### Online Editor: Google Presentation 

Open the helloworld example in the Google Presentation editor. Use the following link: [helloworld](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w48gExh5oLIT0J8xYXR1RxpqTrZTXJC8OR4UXxShTQ8/edit?usp=sharing).	

Make a copy so you can edit.

On Slide 1,  the action is to open the URL of the United Nations in the default web browser.

{% include figure.html src="/img/gdrive_slide1.png" %}   

Change the URL to the URL of another website, for example, http://slides.sikuli.org.

{% include figure.html src="/img/gdrive_change_url.png" %}   

On Slide 2, the action is to display a greeting message and at the same time click on the logo image as indicated in the screenshot.

{% include figure.html src="/img/gdrive_slide2.png" %}   

Replace the screenshot image with the screenshot of another website.

{% include figure.html src="/img/gdrive_change_screenshot.png" %}   

Let's suppose the new target to click is the image of the computer monitor. 
Adjust the location and size of the red rectangle to cover the target

{% include figure.html src="/img/gdrive_adjust_box.png" %}   

Also, change the text of the greeting message.

{% include figure.html src="/img/gdrive_change_text.png" %}

Now, download the slides as a PowerPoint PPTX file.
   
{% include figure.html src="/img/gdrive_download.png" %}

Drag the file to the Sikuli Slides window. Your slides are ready to execute!
   
{% include figure.html src="/img/gdrive_ready_to_execute.png" %}
