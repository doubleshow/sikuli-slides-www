This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Sikuli Slides. It covers topics such as installation, creating and executing slides, and using Sikuli Slides' API in your own programs.

## What is Sikuli Slides?

Sikuli Slides turn presentation slides into executable programs for automating graphical user interfaces (GUI). A Sikuli Slide contains *a screenshot* and *a set of annotations*. The screenshot can be of any part of a user interface, such as a button, a group of buttons, a form, a dialog box, a window, or the entire desktop. The annotations are boxes to indicate targets and text boxes to indicate actions to be performed on the targets.

## Who can use Sikuli Slides?

* Have you ever made slides with screenshots to teach others how to use an interface? Yes, we are talking about screenshots giving people step-by-step instructions where to click and what to type...etc. Now the same slides can be executed directly on others' live interfaces.
* Have you ever made slides with screenshots to describe a test plan to show to your clients? Now the same slides can be executed directly on a live interface.
